            <p>
                JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
                technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript
                on
                the
                client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers
                have
                a
                dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                standard.[11]
                It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
                multi-paradigm,
                supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
                interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
                Document
                Object Model (DOM).
